# -multi-class-classification-image-task

My dataset “Shoe vs Sandal vs Boot Image Dataset” was taken from Kaggle and contains 1,500 images of  shoes, sandals, and boots. 

The dataset is divided into three subfolders, with each folder containing 500  images of a specific type of footwear.

The images are in JPEG format and have a resolution of 512x384 pixels. The dataset is of each subfolder is balanced, with each class containing the same number of images (500).

The dataset was created by Hasibul Muzahid, and the images were collected from various sources, including Google Images, Flickr, and other websites. The images are not manually annotated, and the 
dataset does not include any additional metadata, such as brand or color information.

This dataset can be used for a variety of computer vision tasks, such as multi-class classification, object 
detection, and image segmentation.
